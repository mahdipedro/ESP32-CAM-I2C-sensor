# ESP32-CAM-I2C-sensor
I will show you how to take pictures from the ESP32-CAM camera and MLX90640 thermal camera and store them on the module's SD card. There are certain steps that need to be taken for this project:
## 1- Activating software I2c
## 2- Read the data from both RGB and thermal cameras
## 3- Store the collected data into the SD card
